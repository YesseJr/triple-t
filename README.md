## DESCRIPTION.
* The Tic Toe Game a.k.a noughts and crosses is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

* In this project I aimed to develop a tic tac toe game using a Python programming language step by step so that it will be well understandable to everyone even for those who are not familiar with this programming language to get knowledge on how it is done.
